## Hi there 👋, my name is Ashish Saini



## 🙋‍♂️ About me

![profile view count](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ashishsaini01)

As an End-to-End Data Science Professional focusing on AI and ML, I am currently gaining hands-on experience as a Data Management and Automation Intern at [Munich Re](https://www.munichre.com/de.html). My responsibilities include managing Policies and Claims data for actuarial analysis and automating pipelines for data cleaning and transformation. Simultaneously, I am dedicated to my academic pursuit, pursuing a master's in Data Science at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/).

My research is centered on Anomaly Detection, Computer Vision, and Time Series Analysis. I explore the field of anomaly detection by detecting anomalies in Image and Temporal Datasets. My thesis, [Enhancing uncertainty estimation and outlier detection through confidence calibration for out-of-distribution data](https://github.com/ashishsaini01/master-thesis), aims to improve deep neural networks for outlier and anomaly detection using Uncertainty estimation and Out-of-distribution data.
